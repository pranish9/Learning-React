1.	 INTRODUCTION
In today's digital era, having an online presence is essential for businesses to remain competitive and accessible. Kathmandu Repairing Center Pvt. Ltd. (KRC), a company specializing in electrical engineering services, system maintenance, and the sale of related products, currently lacks a dedicated website. This absence hinders its ability to reach new customers, showcase completed projects, and streamline communication.
This project aims to design and develop a responsive static website using React.js for Kathmandu Repairing Center Pvt. Ltd. The website will serve as a professional digital platform that highlights the company’s expertise, allows potential clients to explore services and products, and provides a convenient way to book appointments or submit inquiries online.
The website will be developed as part of the Semester 6 React Training Project under the Bachelor of Information & Communication Technology program at Asia e University. The development process will follow modern web design principles, using tools like React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Figma, and will be completed within a 1-month timeframe.
This proposal outlines the objectives, problem statement, tech stack, features, and development timeline for the project.

2.	LITERATURE REVIEW
A company’s website is more than just an online brochure—it is a powerful tool for marketing, communication, trust-building, and customer engagement. For service-based businesses like Kathmandu Repairing Center Pvt. Ltd., a well-designed and responsive website is essential to expand reach, display expertise, and provide accessible services to potential clients.
2.1 Importance of Website for Service-Based Businesses
According to Servgrow (2024), electrical service companies with professional websites see up to 40% more inquiries compared to those without one. A website acts as a digital storefront that operates 24/7, allowing businesses to display their services, past work, and customer reviews. It also improves searchability on Google, enabling new customers to discover the company organically.
2.2 Benefits of Static Websites
Static websites are highly suitable for small and medium service businesses as they offer:
•	Faster loading speeds
•	Higher security (no server-side logic)
•	Lower hosting and maintenance costs
These characteristics make static sites an ideal solution for businesses without dedicated IT teams (W3Techs, 2023).
2.3 Role of React.js in Modern Web Development
React.js is a modern JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It promotes the use of reusable components, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. React applications are also compatible with static site generation tools like Vite or Next.js, which helps deliver fast and secure websites (Meta, 2024).
2.4 Mobile-First & SEO-Oriented Design
With over 60% of web searches happening on mobile devices (Statista, 2024), building mobile-responsive websites is no longer optional. Tools like Tailwind CSS help in building fully responsive layouts quickly. Moreover, implementing SEO best practices—such as proper heading structure, meta tags, and alt texts—ensures better visibility in search engine results (Moz, 2024).
2.5 User Experience & Accessibility
A study by Nielsen Norman Group (2022) emphasizes that users judge a website's credibility within the first few seconds. Clean navigation, visible contact points, testimonials, and visual cues significantly impact trust. Building accessible websites also ensures inclusivity for users with different needs.

3.	 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Despite having a well-established reputation in the local market, Kathmandu Repairing Center Pvt. Ltd. currently lacks an official online presence. The absence of a website poses several critical challenges to its growth and digital outreach:
•	Limited Visibility: Without a website, the company is virtually invisible to potential customers searching for services online.
•	Inefficient Communication: All customer interactions occur through phone calls or walk-ins, making the process time-consuming and prone to delays or misunderstandings.
•	Lack of Service Showcase: The company has completed several high-quality projects, but there is no portfolio or testimonial section to demonstrate their credibility and attract new clients.
•	No Online Booking System: Customers cannot book appointments or request service quotes online, resulting in missed opportunities and poor user convenience.
•	Competitive Disadvantage: Competing businesses with even basic websites are more likely to gain trust and attract clients, placing KRC at a disadvantage in the digital marketplace.
These issues highlight the urgent need for a responsive, professional, and SEO-friendly website that reflects the company’s capabilities, enhances communication, and builds digital credibility.
